## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database  

### Introduction

### Gym Management Database

The **Gym Management Database** is designed to efficiently manage information related to gym members, staff, and memberships. This system ensures smooth organization and tracking of essential details such as membership plans, staff assignments, member contact information, and fitness progress.

#### Purpose of the Database
This database serves as a structured and reliable solution for gyms to:  
- **Organize memberships** by type (e.g., monthly, annual) and status (active, expired).  
- **Manage staff assignments** by linking trainers and other staff to specific tasks or clients.  
- **Maintain member details**, including contact information, membership history, and fitness goals.  
- **Store contact information**, including addresses, phone numbers, and emails for members and staff.  
- **Track fitness progress**, such as training routines, goals, and attendance records.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Gym Administrators** can use this database to efficiently manage membership plans, assign staff to clients, and store emergency contacts.  
- **Members** can track their membership status, view assigned trainers, and update personal fitness goals.  
- **Trainers and Staff** can view their assigned clients, schedule sessions, and monitor client progress.  
- **Management** can use the system for record-keeping, scheduling, and communication with both staff and members.  

This structured database helps streamline gym operations, improving organization, member satisfaction, and communication among all parties involved.

# Phase 2: Advanced SQL and Data Manipulation

This phase focuses on advanced SQL operations, including complex queries, data updates, deletions, constraints, and transaction control using ROLLBACK and COMMIT. These elements enhance the reliability, consistency, and functionality of our Gym Management System.

## Transaction Management - COMMIT and ROLLBACK

### COMMIT Example

WHERE memberID = 1;

-- Show the updated result (for screenshot)
SELECT memberID, name, status
FROM members
WHERE memberID = 1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;

-- Verify that the change was saved (for screenshot)
SELECT memberID, name, status
FROM members
WHERE memberID = 1;
```

ðŸ“¸ ![commit\_stage2.png](phase2/resources/commitB_stage2.png) â€“ *Before the COMMIT transaction*
ðŸ“¸ ![commit\_stage2.png](phase2/resources/commitA_stage2.png) â€“ *After the COMMIT transaction*

### ROLLBACK Example

```sql
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Update a member's status to 'Inactive'
-- You can change the ID according to your data
UPDATE members
SET status = 'Inactive'
WHERE memberID = 1;

-- Show the result after the update (for screenshot)
SELECT memberID, name, status
FROM members
WHERE memberID = 1;

-- Rollback the transaction
ROLLBACK;

-- Verify that the original state was restored (for screenshot)
SELECT memberID, name, status
FROM members
WHERE memberID = 1;

```
