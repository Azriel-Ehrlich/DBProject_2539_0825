## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database  

### Introduction

### Gym Management Database

The **Gym Management Database** is designed to efficiently manage information related to gym members, staff, and memberships. This system ensures smooth organization and tracking of essential details such as membership plans, staff assignments, member contact information, and fitness progress.

#### Purpose of the Database
This database serves as a structured and reliable solution for gyms to:  
- **Organize memberships** by type (e.g., monthly, annual) and status (active, expired).  
- **Manage staff assignments** by linking trainers and other staff to specific tasks or clients.  
- **Maintain member details**, including contact information, membership history, and fitness goals.  
- **Store contact information**, including addresses, phone numbers, and emails for members and staff.  
- **Track fitness progress**, such as training routines, goals, and attendance records.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Gym Administrators** can use this database to efficiently manage membership plans, assign staff to clients, and store emergency contacts.  
- **Members** can track their membership status, view assigned trainers, and update personal fitness goals.  
- **Trainers and Staff** can view their assigned clients, schedule sessions, and monitor client progress.  
- **Management** can use the system for record-keeping, scheduling, and communication among all parties involved.  

This structured database helps streamline gym operations, improving organization, member satisfaction, and communication among all parties involved.

## 5. Integration Decisions and Explanations

### Integration Strategy:
- We received a system with two different employee-related tables: `instructors` and `cashiers`.
- To unify them, we created a new table: `employees`, containing the shared fields: `name`, `phone`, and `hourlyrate`.
- We added `employeeid` as a foreign key to both `instructors` and `cashiers`, and migrated the data accordingly.
- We dropped the duplicate fields from the original tables to avoid redundancy.
- We updated foreign keys in related tables (`classes` and `orders`) to reference `employees` instead of the old IDs.

### Key Decisions:
- We avoided creating a junction table and used foreign keys directly.
- Table names were unified (`cashiers` â†’ `cashier`) for clarity and consistency.
- Referential integrity was preserved using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
---
## 6. Explanation of SQL Commands

**File:** `Integrate.sql`

- Create new `employees` table.
- Copy relevant data from `instructors` and `cashiers`.
- Set `employeeid` in both original tables.
- Remove redundant columns and add foreign key constraints.
- Update `classes` and `orders` to reference the unified `employeeid`.
- Rename `cashiers` table to `cashier`.

*Each command is explained with comments directly in the script.*
---
## 7. Views and Queries

### View 1 â€“ `instructor_classes_view` (Instructor Classes View)

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW instructor_classes_view AS
SELECT
    e.employeeid,
    e.name AS instructor_name,
    e.phone,
    e.hourlyrate,
    c.classid,
    c.classname,
    c.classtime
FROM employees e
JOIN instructors i ON e.employeeid = i.employeeid
JOIN classes c ON e.employeeid = c.employeeid;
```

**Explanation:**
This view shows instructors and the classes they teach, including class details and their hourly rate. It combines data from `employees`, `instructors`, and `classes` tables.

#### Query 1.1 â€“ List all instructors and the number of classes they teach

```sql
SELECT
    instructor_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_classes
FROM instructor_classes_view
GROUP BY instructor_name
ORDER BY total_classes DESC;
```

Returns all instructors ordered by the number of classes they teach, descending.
![query1.1.png](phase3/resources/query1.1.png)

#### Query 1.2 â€“ List all instructors and their estimated total income

```sql
SELECT
    instructor_name,
    hourlyrate,
    COUNT(*) AS total_classes,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * hourlyrate, 2) AS estimated_total_income
FROM instructor_classes_view
GROUP BY instructor_name, hourlyrate
ORDER BY estimated_total_income DESC;
```

Shows instructors' total income based on their hourly rate and number of classes they teach.
![query1.2.png](phase3/resources/query1.2.png)
---
### View 2 â€“ `cashier_orders_view` (Cashier Orders View)

```sql
CREATE VIEW cashier_orders_view AS
SELECT
    e.employeeid,
    e.name AS cashier_name,
    o.orderid,
    o.orderdate
FROM orders o
JOIN employees e ON o.cashierid = e.employeeid;
```

**Explanation:**
This view displays each cashier (employee) and the orders they handled. It joins the `orders` table with the `employees` table using the employee ID.

#### Query 2.1 â€“ Number of orders handled per cashier

```sql
SELECT
    cashier_name,
    COUNT(orderid) AS total_orders
FROM cashier_orders_view
GROUP BY cashier_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC;
```

Returns how many orders each cashier processed, ordered by total orders descending.
![query2.1.png](phase3/resources/query2.1.png)

#### Query 2.2 â€“ Count the number of orders handled by each cashier (Alternative approach)

```sql
SELECT 
    c.cashier_name,
    COUNT(o.orderid) AS total_orders_handled
FROM 
    cashier_orders_view c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.employeeid = o.cashierid
GROUP BY 
    c.cashier_name;
```

Alternative method to count orders per cashier using a join with the orders table.

# Phase 4: Programming with PL/pgSQL

This phase focuses on writing PL/pgSQL functions, procedures, and triggers based on the integrated gym database. The goal is to demonstrate advanced server-side logic using the following features:

* Explicit and implicit cursors
* Returning refcursors
* DML operations
* Conditionals
* Loops
* Exception handling
* Records

We implemented:

* 2 Functions
* 2 Procedures
* 2 Triggers
* 2 Main test blocks (each invoking one function and one procedure)

---

BEGIN
    FOR rec IN
        SELECT checkin, checkout
        FROM attendance
        WHERE memberid = p_memberid
          AND date >= p_week_start
          AND date < p_week_start + INTERVAL '7 days'
    LOOP
        IF rec.checkout IS NOT NULL THEN
            total_hours := total_hours + EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (rec.checkout - rec.checkin)) / 3600;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;

    RETURN total_hours;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

    OPEN cur_orders FOR
        SELECT *
        FROM orders
        WHERE cashierid = p_cashierid;
    RETURN cur_orders;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
---

## 3. Procedure: `add_attendance`
